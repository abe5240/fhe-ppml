# Exploring Private Inference with FHE

To train all 54 model configurations, run ```python3 train_models.py``` (note, this will take a while). To use our uploaded checkpoints to verify the test results, run ```python3 test_models.py```. To verify our encrypted inference runtimes, run ```python3 time_encrypted_inference.py```. This will again take a while.
